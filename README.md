### Site Owner Goals ###

* As a **site owner**, I want to create an interactive educational maths game for children.
* As a **site owner**, I want to make sure that children have fun and don't get bored too quickly.
* As a **site owner**, I also want to teach the children a lifeskill how to count money, by starting small with pence coins.
* It is also important to me to receive honest feedback from the parent of the **user** so I can identify how I can improve the game and for recommendations on other educational games their children would benefit from.
* As a **site owner**, I would also like my audience to connect with me on social media platforms.

### User Requirements and Expectations ###

1. The site should have:
   * Game console.
   * Navigation to *information* about the game, including how to play it.
   * Navigation to *contact us* with a fully functioning form.
   * Audio with a button to turn *audio on/off*.
   * Button to *reset the game*.
   * Button to *reset the sum*.
2. The site should be **visually appealing** and **interactive**.
3. The game should have **three levels** and **six tasks** in each level.
4. **Price tag** should be displayed and change it's value on a new task at each level. It should also increase in value on each task.
5. **Level 1** should have **6 coins** displayed to start with and coins should be buttons.
6. Additional coins should be displayed at level 2 and level 3 to add difficulty.
7. Coin should add it's value to the total sum amount when clicked on.
8. Total sum amount should be displayed and it should increase it's value every time a coin button is clicked on.
9. Games console should have six stars displayed, which are highlighted when correct sum is achieved. Stars are reset at each level.
10. With each correct sum a pop up *Congrats* message display appears. The display should have a button to take the user to the next task.
11. At each incorrect sum a pop up *Try again* message display appears. The display should have a button to restart the same task and will trigger the sum reset to 0. The user will not lose the stars they have already won.

### Design Choices ###

The main aim of the design of the site is to make it appealing to the children. It should have multiple colours, buttons should be large and larger fonts utilised where appropriate.

**Fonts**

For the **logo**, I have chosen [Finger Paint](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Finger+Paint?query=finger). This font seemed to me a close resemblance of a child's writing with a paint brush. 
 
For the **level**, **task**, **price tag** and **sum** I have chosen [Love Ya Like A Sister](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Love+Ya+Like+A+Sister?query=love+ya) font. This font seems playful to me. I also liked the fact that there is some transparancy and you can see a bit of the background colour.

For all **headers** I used [Noto Sans JP](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Noto+Sans+JP?query=noto) font and all **other text** [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto?query=roboto).

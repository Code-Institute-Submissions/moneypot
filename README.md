## UX (User Experience) ##

### Project Goals ###

The **goal** of this project is to build an interactive maths game for **children** age 4-6.
Secondary goal of this project is to teach children to identify British Currency pence coins.

### User Goals ###

* **Find the information** what the game is about.
* **Find the rules** how to play the game.
* **Play** the game.
* **Learn** to identify British Currency coins.
* **Learn** simple math sums.
* **Give feedback** about the game and/or **contact** to the site owner.

### User Stories ###

* As a parent of a **user**, I want to make sure the game has educational value.
* As a parent of a **user**, I want to find the rules how to play the game so that I can explain them simply to my child.
* As a parent of a **user**, I want to be able to contact the site owner for more information, to give feedback about the game or to suggest additional features.
* As a **user** I want to have fun!

### Site Owner Goals ###

* As a **site owner**, I want to create an interactive educational maths game for children.
* As a **site owner**, I want to make sure that children have fun and don't get bored too quickly.
* As a **site owner**, I also want to teach the children a lifeskill how to count money, by starting small with pence coins.
* It is also important to me to receive honest feedback from the parent of the **user** so I can identify how I can improve the game and for recommendations on other educational games their children would benefit from.
* As a **site owner**, I would also like my audience to connect with me on social media platforms.

### User Requirements and Expectations ###

1. The site should have:
   * Game console.
   * Navigation to *information* about the game, including how to play it.
   * Navigation to *contact us* with a fully functioning form.
   * Audio with a button to turn *audio on/off*.
   * Button to *reset the game*.
   * Button to *reset the sum*.
2. The site should be **visually appealing** and **interactive**.
3. The game should have **three levels** and **six tasks** in each level.
4. **Price tag** should be displayed and change it's value on a new task at each level. It should also increase in value on each task.
5. **Level 1** should have **6 coins** displayed to start with and coins should be buttons.
6. Additional coins should be displayed at level 2 and level 3 to add difficulty.
7. Coin should add it's value to the total sum amount when clicked on.
8. Total sum amount should be displayed and it should increase it's value every time a coin button is clicked on.
9. Games console should have six stars displayed, which are highlighted when correct sum is achieved. Stars are reset at each level.
10. With each correct sum a pop up *Congrats* message display appears. The display should have a button to take the user to the next task.
11. At each incorrect sum a pop up *Try again* message display appears. The display should have a button to restart the same task and will trigger the sum reset to 0. The user will not lose the stars they have already won.

### Design Choices ###

The main aim of the design of the site is to make it appealing to the children. It should have multiple colours, buttons should be large and larger fonts utilised where appropriate.

#### Fonts ####

For the **logo**, I have chosen [Finger Paint](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Finger+Paint?query=finger). This font seemed to me a close resemblance of a child's writing with a paint brush. 

For the **level**, **task**, **price tag** and **sum** I have chosen [Love Ya Like A Sister](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Love+Ya+Like+A+Sister?query=love+ya) font. This font seems playful to me. I also liked the fact that there is some transparancy and you can see a bit of the background colour.

For all **headers** I used [Noto Sans JP](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Noto+Sans+JP?query=noto) font and all **other text** [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto?query=roboto).

#### Icons ####

I have used icons provided by [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) and are self explanatory.

Icons helped me to enhance visual display, minimise the amount of text and more importantly to ease the navigation, given the game is desiged for young children with limited reading skills.

### Colours ###

I chose the colours that I felt are quite strong and impactfull yet not *"screaming"*.
![Colour palette](/wireframes/colour-palette.png)

* *Gold Metalic* (#D5AE41) used for the **Logo**, to highlight **stars**, **price tag** and **footer**
* For the **nav buttons** used *Madder Lake* (#BD3D3A) , which on hover changes to *Cordovan* (#994044)
* For the **coin background** used *Madder Lake* (#BD3D3A)
* *Ghost White* (#F3F6FB) mainly used for **non-highlighted stars**, **text** and **background colour**
* *Queeen Blue* (#3F69AA) used for **console dashboard**, **sum display**, **information** and **contact form**
  
### Wireframes ###

I designed my site moc-ups using [balsamiq wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/). I was focusing on defining basic layout structure of the game console and identifying how displays would change on different screen sizes such as [mobile](), [tablet]() and [desktop]().

### Images ###

You can find the images of the coins used for the site [here](/assets/images). I have sourced them through various websites, which are free to use:
